=============================

Configuration files that can be deployed in an LDA-compliant server application to offer APIs based on data.gouv.fr metadata.

See more at [https://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/].

The TTL configuration has only been tested with [Epimorphics' Elda](http://epimorphics.github.io/elda/current/) and uses a few non-critical Elda-specific properties.
